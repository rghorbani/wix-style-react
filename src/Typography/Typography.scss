/* 
 * DeprecationWarning: Typography.scss is deprecated.
 * We recommend using the <Heading/> or <Text/> components.
 * If those are not suitable for your need, then see the new classes described here: https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=Styling&selectedStory=1.2%20Typography%20Classes.
 * We recommend using the new classes via the 'Typography.js' and if you require a Sass only styling, then you need to import from 'src/Typography/heading.scss' or 'src/Typography/text.scss' accordingly.
